# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering.ipynb

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** using the
**K-Means clustering algorithm**, an unsupervised machine learning technique.

The goal is to group customers into different segments based on their
purchasing behavior and characteristics, which helps businesses
understand customers better and make data-driven decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand customer behavior through data analysis
- Apply K-Means clustering for segmentation
- Identify optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
- Visualize customer segments clearly
- Gain insights for business strategy and marketing

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Unsupervised Machine Learning
- K-Means Clustering
- Data preprocessing
- Elbow Method
- Data visualization

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains customer-related features such as:
- Customer ID
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- Other relevant attributes

The data is used to identify patterns and group similar customers together.

---

## 🧪 Methodology
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Select relevant features for clustering
4. Use the Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters
5. Apply K-Means clustering
6. Visualize the formed customer segments
7. Interpret the results
